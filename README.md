This academy will always be corrupt ‚Ä¶ because of him.

Chase Stone is hot.
Lethal.
Wicked.

And in charge of a world I don't understand.

I enrolled into Briarcliff Academy to find a better future after my mother was killed and I was left with nothing but a stepfather who wanted to be rid of me.

It only took a few days at my new school before my roommate goes missing, too. Briarcliff‚Äôs most popular student, their princess, is gone.

I keep thinking it should‚Äôve been me.

Because bad luck

Title: Wow!!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2020
Review: My first read from Ketley and won't be my last. I stumbled on Rival from a Amazon recommendation. Thought why not give it a try....and I'm so glad I did!

This story has everything. From drama to angst. It doesn't miss a beat.
Callie is our lovely lady in this story. She gets sent to Briarcliff for her senior year of highschool. Upon arriving she meets Chase the big shot at the school. Shes immediately drawn to him. Thats were the story begins.

The mystery that surrounds this story is what will keep your fingers turning the page. You wont want to put it down because you need to know what happeneds next.

Review: I couldn‚Äôt put this down,it consumed me. A murder, mystery, prep school, secret society dark romance. It wasn‚Äôt so dark that it took away from the plot. This is gripping and has a cliffhanger but not a unsettling one. I do wish it was dual POV but you can sign up for the author‚Äôs newsletter and get some dual action there.

Review: I loved this book! Ketley Allison is one of my favorite authors! Although I do with the pov changed between Callie and Chase, I loved this book regardless! Can‚Äôt wait for the second book.

Title: What a good read
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2022
Review: I admit I was concerned that this book didn't have nearly as many reviews as most of the ones I read. I decided to take a chance anyway, and I'm so glad I did. This book had suspense, bullying, and some spice - all the things I love. I'm still wondering who the female main character can trust. It's hard to know with all the deception and lies. This book definitely ended on a cliffhanger and I'm glad I get to go right into book 2.

Review: Started this book today and finished it just now. All I have to say is wow. So much angst and anger. I felt like I was back in high school again, but my high school didn‚Äôt have this problem. The bullying is monumental in this book.

This is the first book that I have read by this author, and it‚Äôs not going to be the last.

Title: Three stars
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2021
Review: Slow, descriptive of nonessential ‚Äòstuff‚Äô. Tried too hard at times. Bits were at times simply boring and drawn out to lengthen the book. BUT! I did like the storyline and under current stories, hence 3 stars. I won‚Äôt read any further in the series.

Review: This story was completely different from what i expected, but i enjoyed every bit of it! Thank goodness the whole series is released! I would‚Äôve been so mad with the cliffhanger! Chase and Callie click so well together! I love it! Thanks for the great read!
